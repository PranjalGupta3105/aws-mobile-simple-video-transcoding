# aws-mobile-simple-video-transcoding
Add video transcoding to your AWS Mobile Hub-backed Mobile App or Website. This will automatically transcode user-uploaded videos so that videos may be streamed in the downlink direction to devices using an adaptive multi-bitrate protocol (HLS - Http Live Streaming). This reduces bandwidth requirements, reduces playback buffering, and improves user experience in watching the videos.
